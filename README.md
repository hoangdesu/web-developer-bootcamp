## About

This repo is to track my progress for [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course by Colt Steele.

## Reflection

I started this course all the way back in 2021, knowing just enough HTML, CSS and JavaScript to get through my classes at school. This is my first
course on Udemy, which I decided to pick up as a way sharpen my web development skill. I dropped this course somewhere by the end of 2021, to jump to
doing React course. I thought I would never be able to finish it. I'm glad that I revisited it in 2023 and managed to complete it. It's hard to finish
what you started.

Looking back, I really appreciate what I have learned from this course and wanna say this is such a great place for anyone wanting to get their feet
wet in web development. The lessons cover a lot of in-depth knowledge, much deeper and wider from what I learned at school. Colt is such a great
teacher. Of course one course can only do so much. There are still a lot of advanced topics that this course hasn't discussed, but that's our
responsibility to keep on learning.

**TLDR:** valuable course, great teacher, highly recommended üëç
