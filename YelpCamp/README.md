## About

YelpCamp is the final project from Colt Steele's course on Udemy
[The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). It's a
fullstack web application for browsing and sharing camping sites around the world.

Originally the app from the course is server-side rendered using Node and EJS template engine.
However, I wanted to make something that I can proudly call "my own", not "just another YelpCamp
project", so I completely re-designed the app and built it using the MERN stack with TypeScript for
the client-side. Beside the typical CRUD operations, I also implemented a bunch of extra features
like making reservations, user profile, simulated mobile payment with QR code, etc.

## Technologies

##### Frontend

The frontend is written in [React 18](https://github.com/facebook/react) , with the following
additional libraries:

-   [@bitjson/qr-code](https://github.com/bitjson/qr-code): web-component QR code generator for
    simulated mobile payment
-   [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): promise based HTTP client
-   [react-grid-dnd](https://github.com/bmcmahen/react-grid-dnd): for drag and drop images in New
    Campground and Edit Campground pages
-   [react-query (v3)](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/): powerful asynchronous state management,
    server-state utilities and data fetching library
-   [react-router (v6)](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): client side routing library

Multiple <span classname="font-medium">UI libraries</span> are combined for the sake of learning and
utilizing component customization:

-   [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)
-   [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

##### Backend

The backend is powered [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web
framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) .  
Additional libraries include:

-   <a href="" target="_blank">mongoose</a>: Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js
-   [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session): session middleware, paired with
    [connect-mongo](https://github.com/jdesboeufs/connect-mongo) to store session in MongoDB
-   [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport): authentication middleware, paired with
    [Local Strategy](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) and
    [Passport Local Mongoose](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose)
-   [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) and
    [multer-storage-cloudinary](https://github.com/affanshahid/multer-storage-cloudinary):
    middleware for handling uploading images to Cloudinary
-   [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan): HTTP request logger middleware
-   [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet): help secure Express apps with various HTTP headers
-   [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi): data validation library
-   [sanitize-html](https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html): HTML sanitizer for enhanced
    security

##### Third-party APIs

-   [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/): client APIs and server SDKs for map geolocation and geocoding
    services
-   [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/): image storage service
