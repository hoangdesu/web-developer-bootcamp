    <h1>Zed</h1>
    <h2>THE MASTER OF SHADOWS</h2>
    <p>Beneath Ionia’s veil of harmony lie the tales of those left behind. For Zed, his story began as a boy on the cold
        steps of the home of the Kinkou Order.</p>
    <p>Taken in by Great Master Kusho himself, Zed found his place within the temple’s ancient walls. He dedicated
        himself to understanding the Kinkou’s spiritual tenets, quickly outpacing his peers both in combat and study.
        Even so, he felt overshadowed by another—his master’s son, Shen. Though Zed’s passion shone through in every
        technique he perfected, he lacked Shen’s emotional balance. In spite of this, the two pupils became like
        brothers.</p>
    <p>In time, they journeyed together with their master to track down the infamous Golden Demon. When they finally
        succeeded in capturing this feared “monster,” it was revealed to be a mere man named Khada Jhin. The young Zed
        marched forward with his blades held high, but Kusho stopped him, ordering that Jhin be imprisoned instead.</p>
